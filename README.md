## Mimicry
This is the replication Package for the paper *"Targeted Deep Learning Systems Boundary Testing"*. 
The tools components are contained in `src/`, all models should be placed in the subfolders of `models/`. 
For the pretrained models please look at the README files in the respective subfolders.

In `examples/mimicry/` all scripts used for the experiments can be found. 
The notebooks allow you to replicate the results extraction and analysis for each RQ easily.

For the human study we include the raw csv under `examples/mimicry/survey.csv`.
We strongly advice to use conda for installing dependencies.
